ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE.txt
* README.md
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\Jama-1.0.2.jar => app\libs\Jama-1.0.2.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\com\androzic\location\ILocationCallback.aidl => app\src\main\aidl\com\androzic\location\ILocationCallback.aidl
* src\com\androzic\location\ILocationRemoteService.aidl => app\src\main\aidl\com\androzic\location\ILocationRemoteService.aidl
* src\com\androzic\location\ITrackingCallback.aidl => app\src\main\aidl\com\androzic\location\ITrackingCallback.aidl
* src\com\androzic\location\ITrackingRemoteService.aidl => app\src\main\aidl\com\androzic\location\ITrackingRemoteService.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
